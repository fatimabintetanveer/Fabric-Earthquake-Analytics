# Earthquake Analytics With Microsoft Fabric

## Overview
This project is an end-to-end data engineering and analysis pipeline built using Microsoft Fabric. It ingests, processes, and analyzes global earthquake events data, providing actionable insights through reporting and visualization in Power BI.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to transform raw earthquake data into refined, business-ready datasets that are optimized for analytics, reporting, and visualization.

## Architecture

The project architecture follows a Medallion Architecture approach, consisting of three primary layers:

1. **Bronze Layer**: Raw earthquake data is ingested from the USGS API with minimal processing. This layer serves as the foundational data repository.

2. **Silver Layer**: The data is cleaned, transformed, and consolidated. Key fields are extracted, and data is prepared for analytical processing.

3. **Gold Layer**: Refined, business-ready datasets are created. These datasets are optimized for high-value insights and reporting, and are ready for visualization in Power BI.

## Technologies Used
- **Microsoft Fabric**: For data engineering, orchestration, and processing.
- **Data Factory**: For data ingestion and pipeline orchestration.
- **Data Engineering**: For data transformation and storage.
- **Power BI**: For reporting and visualization.
- **Python & PySpark**: For data processing and transformation.
- **USGS API**: As the source for earthquake event data.

## Implementation Steps
Following resources were used to implement the pipeline:

### Bronze Layer: Raw Data Ingestion
- **Objective**: Fetch and store raw earthquake data from the USGS API with minimal processing.
- **Process**: Save the raw data in its original format for further refinement.

### Silver Layer: Data Cleaning & Transformation
- **Objective**: Extract key fields like coordinates, magnitude, and time, and clean the data for analytical use.
- **Process**: Select specific fields, convert time formats, and save the processed data as a table.

### Gold Layer: Data Enrichment & Refinement
- **Objective**: Prepare business-ready data by further refining and enriching the cleaned data.
- **Process**: Add country codes, classify significance, and append data to a final table for reporting and analysis.
